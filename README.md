Files for coding bootcamp sponsored by Emory Women In Neuroscience

We will be using Anaconda, an open platform for data science that makes it much easier to install scientific computing libraries used with Python, R, and other languages.

**Please install Anaconda with the current version of Python, 3.6**
* Windows: https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.3.0.1-Windows-x86_64.exe
* OSX (Mac): https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.3.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
* Linux: https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.3.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

Okay, you should be ready for the bootcamp! All the scientific packages you need come installed already with Anaconda.

### If you already have Anaconda installed:
**You don't have to install a newer version. Just make sure you have a conda environment that uses some version of Python 3.**

Like so:

1. Open up an Anaconda terminal and type

  `> conda create -n bootcamp python=3.5`

  (then hit `Enter`)
  
2. Then do

  (Mac)
  `> source activate bootcamp`

  (Windows)
  `> activate bootcamp`

3. Your command line prompt should now look something like this:
  `(bootcamp) >`.
  
   You're going to install required packages into the environment you've just created. (We'll explain what that means Thursday.)
   
   To install those packages, enter the command 

  `> conda install jupyter pandas numpy pip`

  and say `y` when it asks you whether it's okay to install the dependencies (trust me, it's okay)

To deactivate you just enter `deactivate` (for Windows) or `source deactivate` (for Mac), or simply close the terminal.

You'll want to open an Anaconda terminal and activate that conda environment again when we start using the Jupyter notebooks in the bootcamp.
